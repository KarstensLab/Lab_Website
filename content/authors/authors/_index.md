The Karstens Lab is an interdisciplinary group at Oregon Health & Science University in the Department of Medical Informatics, Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine.  We study the human microbiome and its relationship to health and disease using high-throughput sequencing and analytical chemistry approaches. We specialize in the urinary microbiome and other low microbial biomass niches, but also have projects involving the gut microbiome.
