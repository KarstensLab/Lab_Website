Dr. Karstens presented Rethinking the Role of Bacteria in the Bladder in Overactive Bladder and Urinary Incontinence in the Young Investigator Spotlight at the SUFU 2022 Winter meeting. She also presented on the findings from the HMS-ESTEEM study linking the urobiome to urinary incontinence severity in women with mixed urinary incontinence. Kate Bowie (PhD candidate) also presented her work on male urinary microbiome in men with lower urinary tract symptoms.
