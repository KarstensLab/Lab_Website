2020 has been hard in so many ways, BUT the Karstens lab members have been busy wrapping up their studies. DMICE BCBC Masters students Carter Hoffman and Alfonso Poire completed their programs. Carterâ€™s thesis focused on identifying species-level information from 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. Alfonso completed a capstone/internship at J Craig Venter Institute probing molecular interactions in the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria-feather moss symbiosis. Also, our first EXITO scholar, Fatoumata Jallow, graduated! Her EXITO project explored using additional experimental information to improve urinary microbiome measurements. Finally, urogynecology Fellow Ian Fields, MD completed his training and will be joining OHSU as faculty.    We are sad that were not able to celebrate these accomplishments in person! CONGRATS ALL!
