We are excited to share the microshades R package we have designed to provide custom color shading palettes for improving accessibility and data organization. Approximately 300 million people in the world have Color Vision Deficiency (CVD), so it is important to consider CVD accessibility when creating scientific figures that use color to relay information.

This package includes color palettes, containing 6 base colors with 5 incremental light to dark shades, for a total of 30 available colors per palette type that can be directly applied to any plot. In addition to color palettes, this package can also be used in conjunction with the R package phyloseq to enhance microbiome data visualization. The accessibility and advanced color organization features help data reviewers and consumers notice visual patterns and trends easier.
