The Karstens lab welcomes two undergraduate interns for summer 2021 as part of a [bioinformatics virtual internship](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/medical-informatics-and-clinical-epidemiology/internship-program).

Lily (left in photo) is an undergraduate at the University of Southern California. She is on the pre-medical track pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Human Biology with a minor in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Outside of academics, she enjoys dancing in various styles and is a member of the dance team at USC. She is looking forward to learning more about bioinformatics and the human microbiome this summer. 

Palmer (right in photo) is a senior undergraduate student studying Math and Biology at Lewis and Clark College. She grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado and has spent the past year studying remotely in Vermont and Idaho. Although Palmer is new to the field of bioinformatics and epidemiology, she is  excited to be a part of the Karstens Lab this summer. In her spare time, she enjoys mountain biking, skiing, and spending time in the mountains.
