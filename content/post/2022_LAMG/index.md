At the 2022 Lake Arrowhead Microbial Genomics Conference, the Karstens lab presented recent work on evaluating microbial DNA in blood and the microshades R package at the poster session.

Kate Bowie (PhD candidate) presented "Assessing Microbial DNA in Blood: Does Fraction Matter?â€‹" and Lisa Karstens, PhD presented "microshades: An R package for improving color accessibility and organization of microbiome data".

For more information on microshades, see the [poster pdf](https://github.com/KarstensLab/Presentations/blob/main/2022-LAMG/2022_LAMG_microshades_poster.pdf) and the [microshades repository](https://karstenslab.github.io/microshades).
