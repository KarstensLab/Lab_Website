Welcome summer 2022 interns! The Karstens lab is excited to host two undergraduates as part of the [Undergraduate Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Internship Program](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/medical-informatics-and-clinical-epidemiology/high-school-and-college
).

Elizabeth Riutta (left in photo) is a DMICE 2022 intern for the Karstens lab. Elizabeth is currently a senior at Oregon State University where she will be finishing a degree in mathematics. After graduation Elizabeth hopes to pursue a career in bioinformatics or more broader sense data science.

Anagha (right in photo) is an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pursuing a major in Computer Science with minors in Integrative Biology and Informatics. She is passionate about bioinformatics research, and as part of the Karstens Lab, she is looking forward to studying the human microbiome and the sequencing methods used in its analysis. Outside of academics, Anagha enjoys sketching, swimming, and finding new hiking trails to explore.
