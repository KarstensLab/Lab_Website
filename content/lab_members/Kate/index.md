Kate is a Ph.D. candidate in the biomedical engineering department. Her primary research focus is on targeted sequencing of low-microbial biomass samples and establishing robust methods to analyze samples with high amounts of DNA contamination. Kate applies these techniques towards studying bacterial translocation and the composition of the urinary microbiome in patients with prostate cancer. When not in the lab or during a global pandemic, youâ€™ll find Kate seeing live music, hiking, or petting the neighborhood dogs.
