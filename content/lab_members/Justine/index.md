I’m Justine Nguyen, a first-year graduate student in the Department of Medical and Clinical Epidemiology at Oregon Health & Science University. I am studying Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.
Previously, my master’s work in Bioinformatics revolved around predicting bacterial proteins in the Ovarian Tumor family through the use of generating features and learning from primary amino acid sequences. My interests lie in using computational tools to drive lab experiments and aiding in modeling the underlying biology in a system.
My role in the Karstens lab revolves around aiding in the development of an IgA-seq package to help streamline IgA sequencing analyses.
In my free time, I could be found running, biking, or putting together jigsaw puzzles.
