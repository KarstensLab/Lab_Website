abstract: "When creating figures, it is important to consider that individuals with color vision deficiency (CVD) may not perceive all colors. While there are several CVD-friendly color palettes, they are often insufficient for working with microbiome data. Here, we introduce microshades, an R package for creating CVD-accessible microbiome figures."
