abstract: The urinary microbiome has been increasingly characterized using next-generation sequencing. However, many of the technical methods have not yet been specifically optimized for urine. We sought to compare the performance of several DNA isolation kits used in urinary microbiome studies. A total of 11 voided urine samples and one buffer control were divided into 5 equal aliquots and processed in parallel using five commercial DNA isolation kits. DNA was quantified and the V4 segment of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Data were processed to identify the microbial composition and to assess alpha and beta diversity of the samples. Tested DNA isolation kits result in significantly different DNA yields from urine samples. DNA extracted with the Qiagen Biostic Bacteremia and DNeasy Blood & Tissue kits showed the fewest technical issues in downstream analyses, with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit also demonstrating the highest DNA yield. Nevertheless, all five kits provided good quality DNA for high throughput sequencing with non-significant differences in the number of reads recovered, alpha, or beta diversity.
