abstract: "Little is known about the relationship of proximal urogenital microbiomes in the bladder and the vagina and how this contributes to bladder health. In this study, we use a microbial ecology and network framework to understand the dynamics of interactions/co-occurrences of bacteria in the bladder and vagina in women with and without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI)."
